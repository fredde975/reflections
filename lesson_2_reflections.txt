What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I get a .git folder

I need to do it because it creates a starting point fot my project

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is an area to put files in before you do the final commit.

It lets you think twice before you do an actual commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
add file to stage after editing
